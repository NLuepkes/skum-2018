	2.: The covariance matricies from i and ii are class specific. In our case a class specific cov matrix would mean
		that the deviation of one character (class) from its mean is fundamentally different than the deviation of
		other characters from their respective means. However, the deviation we are talking about is a result of the
		different handwritings of people and without further information there is no reason to assume that the deviations 
		are influenced by the individual characters rather than by the writers handwriting. That means
		without further information we should assume that the deviations are somewhat uniform over the sample taken from one
		person and are independent of the specific characters.


c) 	We failed to log-plot the errors, however here they are:

	lambs = [1,1/2,10^(-1),10^(-2),10^(-3),10^(-4),10^(-5),10^(-6)]

	errors = [0.114598903836572, 0.09118086696562033, 0.9676133532635774, 0.9755854509217738, 0.9541604384653712, 0.9202790234180369, 0.9750871948181365, 0.9262580966616841]

	A big lambda means beeing close to completly class specific covMats, a small one that one almost uses a pooled covMat.
	It appears, that a pooled covMat (lamb = 1) works well, but the best is a nice mix of 50%pooled and 50% specific. 
	Relying more strongly on the class specific share seems to work very poorly. The explanation for this might be closely
	related to our answer in b):
	It seems like the specific characters do have a slight specific tendency for their deviation across all people, however,
	the general deviation (uniform across all characters) determined by a persons handwriting is an important factor aswell
	(actually more important, since soley relying on it works quite well) and the best is a mix of both.
